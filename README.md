# SimpleDiscordArchiver
SDiscordArchiver.py is a (relatively) simple python program for archiving Discord chat logs.
It was intended only for personal use; however, since other people may find this useful, I have made it public.
The "simple" in the name does not mean that it is simple to use; rather, it means that
the program was written in (relatively) simple code. 

You should install python (version >= 3.4) before downloading and running the .py file.

NOTE: This program is insecure, as the OAUTH2 code is not transmitted securely (or rather,
the program does not handle it securely, as I haven't figured that part out yet).
**When you receive a code, do not share it with anyone.**

This is all being done on your local machine, and this program is not a web application or anything like that.
As long as you don't share your code or configuration file with anyone, you _should_ be fine.
That having been said, this is still an issue, and if you're uncomfortable with that
then feel free to skip this program for now.
